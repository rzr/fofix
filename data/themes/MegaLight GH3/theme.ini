loading_phrase = For best results, play at maximum volume -- especially in the presence of authority figures or the elderly._People don't want to pay to see you jam._If the neighbors are complaining about the noise, just turn up the volume until they move away._If the crowd is screaming for more but the sound guy is shaking his head angrily, just ignore him and play anyway._Your mom doesn't count as a fan._Screaming star power is as good a plan as any._If your singer ain't happy, ain't nobody happy._Don't let the drummer have the microphone, it will only end in tears._Life is hard for musicians.  For drummers, it's impossible._If the crowd wants an encore and you've run out of songs, under no circumstances should you try to JAM._If your drummer is too tired for the encore, then he's too tired for the after party._Get a mini-fridge in your practice space, it's more important than a bassist._Don't let your drummer do an extended drum solo, unless you REALLY have to go to the bathroom!_If the police aren't complaining, you're not playing loud enough._Never think you were the first band to wear all black on stage._I used to freak out when my amp caught on fire, but now I kinda dig the tone._There's something wrong with your bass amp, I can still hear it._I swear, officer -- the dressing room T.V. just un-bolted itself from the wall and threw itself out the window!_Maybe a drum machine would show up to practice on time._Turn that amp up, my ears are barely even bleeding._Eleven IS louder than ten._You played great -- they were just booing your outfits._You're only as good as your last gig -- which sucked._Smashed guitars just seem to sound better than their non-smashed brethren._Real guitarists don't sit on the couch while they play._Good Luck!_It's just tradition to show up 30 minutes late to practice._Do not use homemade pyrotechnics._They don't really want you to play Free Bird, they're just heckling you._Going into practice will allow you to nail those tricky solos._Remember, NO STAIRWAY!_Never leave your lead singer in charge of the mix._I'm the drummer, I don't get paid to understand any of this!_Let's open with our latest single.  That way we can get that piece of %&?#! out of the way early!_Star Power can be a life saver!  If you're deep in the red, use Star Power to win the crowd back.
